## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Sass/SCSS

### What I learned

This was a really interesting challenge. I got the chance to practice my layout skills. Also some nice and very useful components such as the mobile menu, the tabs and the faq accordion.

### Continued development

As I keep learning and some things become second nature, it gives me the chance to focus more on the aspects I don't feel very comfortable yet. I am starting to understand a lot more about UX and accessibility as well as JS.
